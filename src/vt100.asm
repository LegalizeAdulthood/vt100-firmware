; Documentation random things:
; 1. Sequences not mentioned in User Guide:
;    a) DECHCP and its VT52 equivalent ESC ];
;    b) DECGON/DECGOFF,
;    c) SS2 and SS3.
;    DECHCP and DECGON are dependent on GPO anyway, but SS2/SS3 work for unexpanded VT100.
;    DECHCP is mentioned in TM p.A-21
;
; Comments on notation in comments:
; A <- x means "A becomes/is set to x", which frees up "=" to be the straightforward mathematical "is equal to"
; HL <- x means HL becomes x, mostly implying that HL is now a pointer to something at location x.

; self_test

; The only difference between "proper" POST and the Self Test invoked by DECTST is making sure that POST
; doesn't repeat indefinitely. As register E is a mask of requested tests and repeat indication, POST sets
; the mask just as if DECTST had been invoked with "just self-test, no repeats."
;
; TM ยง4.2.8, "Power-Up and Self-Test", p. 4-19, describes POST.
;
post:		mvi	e,1		; Pretend this is DECTST and we requested POST without repeats
;
; Self-test starts by checksumming ROMs, which is a rotate-and-XOR operation across all four 2K ROMs
; individually. The checksum is expected to produce a zero result, which is ensured by including a
; byte somewhere in each ROM that can mix-in to make zero. Checksum bytes are marked in this listing
; where they have been identified.

; Key map. Keys are received from the keyboard in a column/row form, shown in TM Figure 4-4-4,
; "Keyboard Switch Array". This table is arranged in natural order, by columns as
; labelled in that figure, except there are just 11 rows for each column (most of the remaining
; key codes being either absent or corresponding to key modifier functions like SHIFT, which
; were weeded out by the keyboard interrupt.
;
; Because the first three keys of column 0 (rows 0 to 2) are absent from the array (i.e. these
; scan codes are never sent by the keyboard), this table is overlapped by three bytes with
; key_shift_map, hence the equate below. So, at first glance, each column should have 11 rows,
; but column 0 appears to have 8.
;
; Numeric keypad entries have their "normal" ASCII code with the top bit set, so that KP9 is
; '9'|80h, i.e. 0b9h. However, asm8080 won't let me write '9'|80h in a DB directive without
; parenthesizing, so I'm just leaving hex values here. Whinge over.
;
; For stability, because of its big reversed "L" shape, the RETURN key has two switches,
; with scan codes 04h and 64h. This table converts 04h to 0 and 64h to 13 (i.e. C0_CR) so
; that it only counts once.

; There is a bug with character set mapping at the line marked [* BUG *] below.
;
; To find out which character should be printed, the number in gl_invocation (normally 0 or 1),
; is added to the address g0_charset, which is 20fdh, and the encoding designated into that set
; will be used to print a character. If a single shift is in effect, the number in gl_invocation
; will have been increased by 2, so G0 invoked into GL will have become G2 invoked into GL for
; a single character. If SHIFT OUT (^N) was already in effect, such that G1 was invoked into GL,
; and then a single shift is applied, G3 will be invoked into GL.
;
; At this point, the address of g0_charset (20fdh), in HL, has 3 added to it to find the mapping,
; except that the addition only affects the L register, making HL now point to 2000h, when it
; should be pointing to 2100h.
;
; Because 2000h always contains the value 7fh, as the start of the video DMA stream, this bug
; will make it appear as if the United Kingdom character set had been invoked, regardless of the
; SET-UP condition.
;
; To demonstrate this, the following three sequences should produce a string of three '#' (hash)
; characters, but the third one will produce two '#' and a 'ยฃ' (pound).
;
;
;	a) SI # SO # SI #	(designations being G0, G1, G0)
;	b) SI # ESC N # #	(     "         "   G0, G2, G0)

;	DECLL - ESC [ Ps q [* BUG *]
;
;	Single Ps parameter:
;	0 - clears all LEDs
;	1 - lights L1
;	2 - lights L2
;	3 - lights L3
;	4 - lights L4
;
;	This routine either masks four lowest bits to zero for Ps = 0,
;	on constructs a single-bit-on mask that it can OR with the existing
;	LED state value. No writing of the LED state to the keyboard is done
;	here, so presumably that's a periodic thing elsewhere.
;
;	However, this routine has a bug. It checks for a zero parameter, and then
;	subtracts 5 from any non-zero parameter, bombs out for a positive result,
;	and then attempts to make a LED mask with the result (Ps - 5). However,
;	values of Ps between 133 and 255 will still be negative when 5 is subtracted,
;	meaning that some of them will make masks to affect bits 4 - 7, and these will
;	be sent to the keyboard without further censoring. The keyboard byte itself
;	is described in TM Figure 4-4-2 (_see_ iow_keyboard)
;
;	This bug accounts for the strange behaviour documented by John 'Sloppy' Millington
;	in his "VT100 Oddities" document: https://vt100.net/dec/vt100/oddities
;
;	To find out which bit will be set by this routine, calculate (260 - Ps) % 9.
;	Result  Effect
;	 0 - 3  lights one of the LEDs L1 to L4 in the normal fashion
;	     4  lights the keyboard locked LED such that it cannot be unlit
;	     5  lights the online/local LED such that it cannot be unlit
;	     6  sets "start scan", which will result in a mad repeat rate
;	     7  sets "speaker click", which will make the terminal beep continuously
;	     8  leaves a 1 in the carry flags, so it is completely harmless

;	This routine is used to implement an action for SS2 and SS3, neither of which are
;	documented as being supported in the VT100 User Guide, though they are mentioned
;	the Technical Manual as being supported by the "VT100 Family."
;
;	SS2 (ESC N) is supposed to invoke G2 into GL for a single printable character,
;	after which the terminal reverts to the previous invocation, G0 or G1. SS3 (ESC O)
;	is supposed to do the same with G3.
;
;	What they actually do on the VT100 is to act identically, in increasing the current
;	invocation by two sets, so that they will both invoke G2 into GL if G0 was previously
;	there, or invoke G3 into GL if SHIFT OUT was previously in effect. After a single
;	displayed character, the invocation drops by two sets, leaving the terminal as before.
;
;	This behaviour is cheaper to implement than the correct one, and doesn't make any
;	difference because both G2 and G3 have the default character set (ASCII or UK)
;	designated at start-up, and there is no way to designate anything else.
;
;	In fact, the only way you can tell the difference between the VT100 ignoring these
;	controls completely and implementing them is by designating the Special Graphics Set
;	into G0, invoking it to GL and then using SS2 and sending a character that would be
;	different between the two sets. For example:
;
;		ESC ( 0 a ESC N a a
;
;	On a terminal that didn't support this sequence at all, the above sequence would
;	display three lowercase "a" characters. On the VT100, this will display a checkerboard,
;	a lowercase "a", and another checkerboard.

; decom_mode [* BUG *]
;	This routine changes origin mode and sends the cursor to the home position.
;	However, this routine contains a bug because it calls cursor_home, and that routine
;	clears the first two CSI parameters before dropping into the general cursor positioning routine.
;
;	That means that, if DECOM is the first mode in an RM or SM sequence, the second mode will be
;	cleared by cursor_home and won't be executed. This can be shown by using a highly visible change
;	for the second parameter, such as DECSCNM (screen mode - light or dark).
;
;	For example:
;	1. Go into reverse screen mode: ESC [ ? 5 h
;	2. Go into normal screen mode:  ESC [ ? 5 l
;	3. Set origin mode and reverse screen mode: ESC [ ? 6 ; 5 h
;
;	The third sequence will completely ignore DECSCNM (private mode 5). However, third and
;	subsequent modes will still be processed, so this works:
;
;	4. Set origin mode and reverse screen mode: ESC [ ? 6 ; ; 5 h

;
; This section has to deal with parameter values, which are sequences of ASCII digits '0' to '9',
; separated with ';' and recognising intermediate and final characters. Intermediates are from
; SP (20h) to '/' (2fh), Finals are from '@' (40h) to '~' (7eh) and most other characters will
; invalidate the sequence. Because the VT100 doesn't support any sequences with intermediates,
; it gathers them, along with other invalid characters, and only disposes of them when a Final
; character has been found and the sequence is executed.
;
; This section has a bug at the marked line. Any character other than a digit is supposed to be
; passed through to finish_param, which puts aside the current character while the gathered current
; numeric parameter (param_value) is placed at the end of the list (csi_params). Then, the current
; character is restored from the stack and we drop through to detect_i_f, to determine what to do
; with the current character. Characters above the digit range, like the semicolon or final characters,
; will be dealt with correctly here, but characters below digit range (intermediates) have already
; been corrupted by having 30h subtracted from their value, leaving them in the range 0f0h to 0ffh,
; and detect_i_f will incorrectly treat them as final characters, leading to immediate execution of
; the sequence, with a final character in this high range, which fails to match any of the tables.
;
; A valid but unsupported sequence like: ESC [ 9 ! p
; will be executed by the VT100 on reaching the '!', leaving the parser in "ground" state, which
; means that the final character "p" will be displayed on the screen.
;
; With this bug, the bytes from the label not_final to the next "ret" (17 bytes) are all unreachable.
;
; If the buggy line is replaced by:
;
;	cmp '0'
;
; then all the rest works as intended.

;
;	The sequences CUP (CSI H) and HVP (CSI f) both come here, as they have identifical effects on all
;	models of DEC VTs.
;
;	This routine has a bug in that it starts off by storing the origin mode flag in the C register,
;	but can lose track of that and use C for a row number instead, but then make a further decision
;	as if it still contained the flag.
;
;	The fault path is triggered if we are not in origin mode, which means the code validates the
;	row parameter against the last row of the screen, not the bottom margin. At this point, C is
;	changed from storing the origin mode flag to storing the requested new row. Next, the column
;	number is validated by checking the column number against either the right margin (origin mode)
;	or the last column on the screen (non origin mode). If we are in origin mode, the test proceeds
;	as intended, but if we were not in origin mode, using the right margin or last column depends
;	on whether the new internal row number is 0 or not. If it is non-zero, we check the right margin
;	(i.e. acting like origin mode) instead of last column.
;
;	This bug constrains the cursor column update to the right margin even if origin mode is not in
;	effect. However, the VT100 doesn't have settable left and right margins, and the right margin is
;	only ever different from last column number on double width lines. So there is no case in which
;	this code will allow the setting of a column number beyond the right margin, which means the
;	corruption of the middle-of-line terminators on double width lines cannot occur. (In any case, all
;	cursor moves are then re-validated by _see_ move_updates.)
;
;	The effect of the bug is that cursor moves from a line that is double-width to a line that is
;	single width are constrained by the right margin of the current line, provided the new row
;	is anything other than row 1, which is incorrect.
;
;	This is demonstrated by test t/margin-bug.txt. [* BUG *]

;	This is designed to return a mask that matches the number passed to modem_signals, i.e.
;	01h will indicate that RTS (ready to send) worked,
;		because the modem returns CTS (clear to send) and CD (carrier detect)
;	02h will indicate that SPDS (speed select) worked,
;		because the modem returns SPDI (speed indicator)
;	04h will indicate that DTR (data terminal ready) worked
;		because the PUSART status indicates DSR (data set ready)
