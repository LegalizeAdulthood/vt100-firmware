# Awnty (Are We Nearly There, Yet?)

A coverage checker for code running on the 8080 CPU. Very much a hacked-up piece of
code based on Nicolas Allemand's 8080 CPU emulator.

As of August 2022, trying to split the horrendous all-in-one of awnty.c into files
with specific functions, to make it clearer for me. You probably don't want to be
looking at this or using it.
